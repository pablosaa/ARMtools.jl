## Julia package to read and process data from the ARM Facility.

This repository contains the ``ARMtools.jl`` Julia packate with a suit of modules to process data from the USA Department Of Energy's ![Atmospheric Radiation Measurement](https://www.arm.gov) (ARM) facility.
Currently the package is being developed considering only instruments from the North Slope Alaska site in Utqiagvik. Although some of the instruments are standard for the ARM sites, it might need some tunes.

## Acknowledges
This package is part of the ![(AC)Â³](https://www.ac3-tr.de) project, sub-cluster B07 for the study of the influence of Leads and Polynyas on micro- and macro-physical cloud properties.
